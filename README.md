<p>Testing foliage with VFX graph, this method of drawing the alpha resulted in a ton of overdraw, increasing GPU times. Foam and ripples added to enhance the look of the ocean surface from below.</p>

<h1>March Week 4</h1>
<p>URP test, found to be difficult to add caustics to surfaces receiving main light, so URP is cut.</p>

<p>HDRP test with volumetric lighting, overall underperformant so volumetrics were cut.</p>
