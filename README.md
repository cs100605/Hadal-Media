<h1>April Week 1</h1>

<p>Testing the kelp shader, seems to work for now, but it will need to offset the wave function by world position to make them move differently from each other.</p>

<p>Testing a different foliage method, this time using an opaque rendering method, preventing overdraw on the GPU.</p>

<br/> 

<p>Testing foliage with VFX graph, this method of drawing the alpha resulted in a ton of overdraw, increasing GPU times. Foam and ripples added to enhance the look of the ocean surface from below.</p>

<h1>March Week 4</h1>
<p>URP test, found to be difficult to add caustics to surfaces receiving main light, so URP is cut.</p>

<br/>

<p>HDRP test with volumetric lighting, overall underperformant so volumetrics were cut.</p>
